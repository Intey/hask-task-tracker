# Backlog

Backlog is just list of issues grouped by sprint (or without sprint).

Backlog contains: 
- Sprints
- Issues of project

Issue can be assigned to Sprints. 
By default all issues has state: InBacklog | InSprint.
Previous Sprints as separate field.
So, for getting all issues, we call ProjectBacklog, that contains issues, 
and sprint (not archived) which contains issues.

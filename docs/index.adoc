# Common

## For What

Simplify many issues, with SBRF politics.

### BAD: Create release

- Make Issue with special type
- Link issues of release with special link type (partOf)
- Link only bug/story
- Bug has hard workflow, that commonly fast-forwarded
- Special fields, that can be setted automatically

### BAD: Jira dashboard

- can't view grouped by user
- when many projects and people works, jira hangs

# Highlights

- fast works, because simple and for 1 project
- proxy over jira
- simplify burocraty

## Simplified features

- autofill fields (scripted?)
- override workflow with special script or fast-forward methods
